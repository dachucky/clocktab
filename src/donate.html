Hi, I'm Romuald and I'm the creator of Clock Tab.
</p>

<p>
For the longest time, I refused to put ads on Clock Tab. I don't like ads.
</p>

<p>
But I really want to improve Clock Tab.
Much more (and well polished ones!) themes, better theme customization, better page load speed, etc.
Ads and donations will allow me to dedicate more time to improve Clock Tab.
I can't wait to work again on Cock Tab!
</p>

<p>
If you are like me and you don't like ads, you can donate any amount you want.
You can donate any amount you want in the realm of your capactiy. I mean it, 
to me, the gesture is worth as much as the money itself and will motivate me to improve Clock Tab.
I will then give you a hidden code to remove ads on Clock Tab.
(Even if you donate only 0,01$ :-).)
</p>

<p>
To donate, email me at <a id="contact"></a>.
<script>
  var email = 'clocktab';
  email+='@';
  email+='brillout';
  email+='.';
  email+='com';
  const contactEl = document.getElementById('contact');
  contactEl.innerHTML = email;
  contactEl.setAttribute('href', 'mailto:'+email);
</script>
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward for a bright Clock Tab future :-). (Btw. feel free to let me know if you have any whishes regarding Clock Tab in your email.)
</p>

<p>
Yours sincerely,
</p>

<p>
Romuald
