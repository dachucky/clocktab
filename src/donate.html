Hi, I'm Romuald, the creator of Clock Tab.
</p>

<p>
For the longest time, I refused to put ads on Clock Tab. I don't like ads.
</p>

<p>
But I want to improve Clock Tab.
Much more (and well polished ones!) themes, better theme customization, better page load speed, and so on and so forth.
Ads and donations will allow me to maintain and dedicate time to improve Clock Tab.
</p>

<p>
If you don't like ads, you can donate to remove ads on Clock Tab.
Any amount you are capable of donating is welcome.
Even it's only 0,01$,
your gesture is worth to me as much as the money.
I will then give you a hidden code to remove ads.
</p>

<p>
To donate, email me at <a id="contact"></a>.
<script>
  var email = 'clocktab';
  email+='@';
  email+='brillout';
  email+='.';
  email+='com';
  const contactEl = document.getElementById('contact');
  contactEl.innerHTML = email;
  contactEl.setAttribute('href', 'mailto:'+email);
</script>
</p>

<p>
I'm looking forward for a bright Clock Tab future :-).
</p>

</p>
If you have any whishes regarding Clock Tab, let me know in your email!
<p>

<p>
Yours sincerely,
</p>

Romuald
