<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>

non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Clock ++&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
information is to better understand how Clock ++&#8217;s visitors
use its website so we can make improvements. From time to time,
Clock ++ may release non-personally-identifying information in
the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
website.</p>


<p>
Clock ++ avoids collecting potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses except to the extent
necessary to provide certain services.

<p>Clock ++ may collect statistics
about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Clock ++ discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on Clock ++&#8217;s behalf or to provide services available

faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
of Clock ++, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
registered user of a Clock ++ website and have supplied your
email address, Clock ++ may occasionally send you an email to
tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date

use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we
expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for
example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve
the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
or to help us support other users. Clock ++ takes all measures
reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information.</p>
